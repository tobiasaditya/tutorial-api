# tutorial-api

This is a simple straight-forward backend service using FastAPI to get data, demonstrate query and path parameter. Use a static data, saved in dictionary, each end point will return string if data found and return exception if not found with status 404

This service is deployed and linked to railway. (Currently, it is down, cause railway has limited time for free tier)

Hope this helps as an introductory to backend service using FastAPI
